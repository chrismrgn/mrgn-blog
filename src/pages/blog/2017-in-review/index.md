  - Year in Review

---

2017 has been an interesting year that has led me to learn some new technologies and spend a lot of time away from my specialism, SDL. This has meant my blog output (and new blogging home [http://wearestagetwo.com/blog](http://wearestagetwo.com/blog)) have been much quieter than I would have liked. I only managed 11 (including this one) in 2017.

###### **February**

I decided that it was time for a career change, after 9 years with Building Blocks. After some careful deliberation, I decided that I wanted to try my hand at being my own boss.

I toyed with the idea of being completely solo, but decided the best course for me was to partner with good friends and previous colleagues at [Stage Two UK](https://wearestagetwo.com).

###### **May**

So, fast forward a few months and after finishing a project I was committed too, Stage Two USA was born.

No sooner was the formation complete, and I had a great opportunity that led me away from my SDL roots and into new territory. I deliberated the opportunity for some time, but after a 4-day workshop (aka unconventional interview) I knew it was too good a chance to refuse.

###### **June**

My first project under my own company would be as Solution Architect for a Salesforce, CloudCraze, SAP, NodeJS, micro-services, React and Typescript project spread across several countries and a large team of business and IT colleagues.

I've been a consultant for a long time, with some very large companies, so the geographic and people aspects of the project did not phase me. I'd also spent a fair bit of personal time investigating micro-services, so that was in my wheelhouse too. The other technical aspects of the project (Salesforce, Cloudcraze, and SAP) on the other hand were new to me, and a little scary. The closest I'd really come to Salesforce before was basic integration for CRM and form data capture.

###### **June/July**

I jumped into the project, learning the intricacies of the fashion industry and the new technologies. Luckily for me, our team has many subject matter experts available to guide me around any major pitfalls.

###### **August**

Perfectly timed, right in the middle of a busy project, it was time to get married.

###### **September**

Again, as if planned at the most inopportune time, September was honeymoon time. Rebecca and I had a long-planned trip to spend 5 weeks touring South Africa, Botswana, and Zimbabwe followed by another couple of weeks in the UK.

###### **October - December**

Refreshed after extended traveling, and an [SDL MVP retreat](http://www.mrgn.co/2017/10/06/sdl-web-mvp-retreat-2017-day-1/), it was time to dive back into the project. Long hours, lots of air miles, and hard work the project is progressing well.

Back-office integration and technologies like SAP, TIBCO and Informatica have progressed much more smoothly than expected at the beginning.  While "easy" parts like UI/UX face challenges, mostly related to data quality.

###### **2018**

In 2018 I'm looking forward to seeing the project through and seeing it go-live!

My resolution is to blog early (I'm sure I made the same one last year) and more frequently. I'm planning to start by looking into the new Deployer workers and of course, SDL Tridion Sites 9!

Happy New Year!
