I had a spare minute, so thought I would get a second entry into the [Bookmarklet Challenge](http://meta.tridion.stackexchange.com/questions/324/the-tridion-bookmarklet-challenge), following my original entry [here](http://www.mrgn.co/2014/12/bookmarklet-challenge-get-an-items-webdavurl/ "Bookmarklet Challenge: Get An Items WebDavURL").

So without further ado here is the link, \[xyz-ihs snippet="Bookmarklet-Schema"\].

Now the code. The code is not perfect, but it appears to do the job in both Chrome and FireFox. It needs a bit of work in IE.

All the same thank you's as as last time, especially [Alexander Orlov (UI Beardcore](http://tridion.uibeardcore.com/ "Orlov")).

Next, again, I need to remove that ugly \[setTimeout\] function
