Getting a [Google Voice](http://www.google.com/googlevoice) phone number without a physical phone number proved challenging but I refused to be beaten! Stick it to the man! I have found a way to make and receive FREE\* phone calls and text messages in the USA. Plus an added bonus; keeping in touch with the USA while traveling elsewhere in the World. Google Voice you helped my transition into a new land!

_\*You must have at least one friend. That friend must have a physical number. Internet Connection required._

Recently I faced a problem. I moved to the US of A and started to make new friends. Ok no problem so far. Here is the problem; I only had a UK phone number. Giving new friends my UK phone number was not working out, it cost me (my company) lots of money to contact said “new found friends” and them a lot of money to receive my calls and vice versa.

So I went about looking for a solution to my problem. I was not quite ready to plunge into the world of obtaining a physical USA telephone number for 2 reasons. I had only been in the USA less than a week! My UK iPhone was locked to my provider and I was yet to find a suitable back street establishment that would do the unlocking process.

Here is where Google Voice comes in; Google Voice offers its users a FREE regional US phone number with online inbox and calling facilities. If you have patience you can even choose the exact number you want. I was sold even without exploring the many features that make Google Voice a choice for millions of people with a physical number.

Damn! Another problem!You need a physical phone number to register a Google Voice number!

Don’t worry I managed to find a way around this, all you need is at least one friend willing to let you “borrow” their number for a few minutes. It does not matter if they have Google Voice already, it will still work. Simply follow the steps below:

#### Creating a Google Voice Account without a Physical Phone Number

1. Visit [http://www.google.com/voice](http://www.google.com/voice).
2. Once logged in to your Google account (or creating a new account) you will be presented with the following screen.[![](http://67.205.159.130/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/gv1111.png "Google Voice Get Started")](http://67.205.159.130/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/gv1111.png)
3. Most likely you will be selecting “I want a new number” which will prompt you to select an “Area or zip code” and/or “Word, phrase, number”. The values entered here will determine the phone numbers you are offered. “Area or zip code” will influence the first 3 digits (area code) so for example entering “San Francisco” will result in numbers beginning with the 415 extension; and the “Word, phrase, number” value will influence the rest of the number, trying to match you entry to a phone number thus making it easier to remember. Don’t worry you can search for as long as your patience allows. Mine stretched to two searches.
4. Follow the additional steps of the wizard; Enter a PIN, accept the Terms & Conditions etc.
5. When you get to the Add a forwarding phone you need the assistance of the previously mentioned friend. Enter their physical phone number. This needs to be a real number and you need to be in contact with said friend as Google will call the number and provide a confirmation number which you must enter to proceed.[![](http://67.205.159.130/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/gv211.png "Google Voice Verification Code")](http://67.205.159.130/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/gv211.png)
6. Google Voice will call the chosen “forwarding number” and ask you to enter the 2 digit verification number. Enter the number and YOUR DONE! You know have a Google Voice Number!
7. You can now explore the web interface to your new “phone”.[![](http://67.205.159.130/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/gv311.png "Google Voice Getting Started")](http://mrgn.info/mrgn.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/gv3.png)
8. There is one final step; your friend probably does not want all you calls forwarding to them. It is now time to un-register your friends number from your account. If you friend already had Google Voice they should log into their account and add a “forwarding number” reclaiming the number and therefore removing it from your account. If they did not have a Google Voice account you need one more small favor from them! They will have to register for a number and claim the number from you following the above steps. If you have difficulty persuading them on this part tell them how cool the service is and all the perks they will receive. If they still say no, they can register and never use the number and continue to use the phone as before with no noticeable side affects.

For anyone familiar with Google's interface and with a reasonable level of web awareness this whole process can be completed with ten minutes! Well unless you get caught up trying to spell your name in your phone number....

If you are still thinking why? Then Google Voice has a few added benefits not advertised on the website which I have come to discover over time. The most notable for me is being able to make and receive calls and text messages from anywhere in the world as if I was in the USA.

I really hope Google Voice can over come the billing structure of phone networks in Europe and spread across the Atlantic.
