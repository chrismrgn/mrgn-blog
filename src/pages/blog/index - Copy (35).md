People like to consume content in very different ways, but the common theme is "I'll read that later". I, like many other people, have my preferred 'bookmarking' method for keeping up-to-date with whats happening in the Tridion world.

For me, it is [IFTTT.com](http://ifttt.com) and in particular my shared 'recipe:' [https://ifttt.com/recipes/122004](https://ifttt.com/recipes/122004). The 'recipe' emails me every time there is a new post in one of the RSS feeds I follow on Feedly (formally Google Reader). Now I just need to make sure I follow all the feeds...

For comparison, I also like Scott Hansekman's Instapaper approach:
