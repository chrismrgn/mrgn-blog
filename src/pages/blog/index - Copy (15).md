Every project I work on, the editors, contributors and business owners talk about _Notifications_. They want to know what is changing, when, and what is effected.

In 2016, I plan to revisit previous community projects, like Bart's [Tridion Notification Framework](https://github.com/bkoopman/tridion-notification-framework), and try to make a generic solution to a common problem.

When this request comes up, we always talk about the same things, email vs. reports, should it be Workflow, and what constitutes a change (not every save is a "release").

So, as part of this project, I'll try to address these things and hopefully build something that provides value without excessive noise.

SubscribersÂ should chose what they get, when they get it, and via which channel...
