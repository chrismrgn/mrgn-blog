For the fourth time, I'm honored to be selected as an SDL MVP and have the pleasure of traveling to Portugal. Every year it is a surprise where exactly we'll end up, with Carla keeping it top secret. All we know is a time and a place to meet at Lisbon airport... Then we board vehicles and drive out of Lisbon, to a mystery location.

Carla never disappoints on location, and this year is no exception as you can see below. Driving up to Ourém, Portugal we were very impressed and excited (and slightly scared by the steep roads) for the 4 days ahead.

###### Night Zero

As customary, the first night is our chance to reconnect with distant peers, eat way too much delicious food, chat about projects, this year's challenges and drink a _few (too many)_ welcome drinks (the wise amongst us pacing ourselves, with more late nights ahead).

###### Day One

Day one starts early_\-ish_, with the SDL team giving us a sneak peek into the roadmap for 2018 and beyond. Things that might happen, things that won't happen and things they'd like some feedback on. An interesting discussion point was the extension (events system etc..) deployer, which will make life much easier in scaled out, cloud environments.

Then, after a short sunshine break, we get into the meat of the retreat. Starting with a (heated) discussion, we propose small projects that we could achieve over the few days together. Selecting which of the small work packages peaks our individual interests, and forming small teams, we disperse to build something cool.

Of course, we can't code on an empty tummy so first lunch!

After lunch, we got coding deciding to work on Peter's Tridion PowerShell Modules (https://github.com/pkjaer/tridion-powershell-modules). Firstly adding some documentation to the existing (and very useful) scripts before identifying new use cases and writing some code.
